# Wistar Docker-compose

This directory contains an example configuration.py file, a blank local database file, and a docker-compose file.

By issuing the `docker-compose up -d` command you can configure wistar using the local configuration file and it 
will be mapped into the container in the appropriate place. This will also ensure any created topologies are kept
between upgrades.
